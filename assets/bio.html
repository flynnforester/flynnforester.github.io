        	Majoring in Visual Arts with a Double Concentration in Printmaking and Design
			</h2>
        	<p>
			Art encourages me to be constantly learning. I take every art piece as a research project, an opportunity to learn something new about the world around me and the environment I live in as well as a chance to learn more about myself. The most important thing in life is to be constantly learning and consistently pushing yourself outside your comfort zone. I use art as a process to understand my surroundings better. Whether those surroundings are new people, concepts, or practices. And transferring those ideas into art means I can also share my findings. 
			My work uses a lot of loud colors and bold messages. I draw a lot of inspiration from Andy Warhol with my prints and Massimo Vignelli for my design work with his bold text, simple design, and bright colors. I like making loud artwork. The more bold colors or statements I can squeeze in the more I feel as though I can be seen and heard since I can be very shy in person. The subject matter of my work changes with the times but I have recently been focused on making work that is accessible to anyone regardless of whatever disability they may have and making all work in the future with accessibility planned in rather than thought of after.
