I know quarantine is for the best and I have no problems staying inside to make sure people are safe, but it’s been so long and the end is nowhere in sight.

Stop corrupting your youth. No one likes you dried up and shoved in a salad. You are like the raisin that no one asked for, but much worse. Why do you have to have that stupid squishy texture? Why won’t my salads stop being made with cranberries? I do not enjoy you and you have no place in my home or my body. Get a hobby. "</div>
