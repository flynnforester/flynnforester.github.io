                <li>Turn the motherboard over and place the backplate on. When handling the motherboard, try to only touch the edges or metal components, to avoid getting skin oils on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board).</li>
                <li>Grab the thermal compound. You'll want to apply a very small amount to the CPU to provide a thin layer once squished down by the cooler. You can always wipe it off if there is too much and try again.</li>

                <li>Make a plan for airflow configuration. You'll want to have at least 3 fans. Some cases come with an extra fan or two, but you'll most likely want to buy some extra as these aren't always the best quality.</li>
                <li>While taking the screws out of the case you'll want to keep them separated and labeled.</li>
                <li>Install any fans and reroute any cables to get ready to install the motherboard. You'll want to route the wires according to where they plug in on the motherboard.</li>

                <li>Check the orientation of the IO shield up against the motherboard and install into case by pushing on each corner of the shield to lock it into place.</li>
                <li>Check your case instructions for installing any standoffs for the motherboard.</li>
                <li>Double check the standoffs and IO shield by picking up the motherboard by the CPU cooler and placing it into the case at a slight angle.</li>
                <li>Screw in the motherboard. Be careful not to over tighten the screws.</li>

                <li>Determine if the fan of the power supply unit should be facing up or down, depending on the amount of space below your case and airflow pattern.</li>
                <li>Screw in power supply unit. Grab the cables from the box and begin plugging them into the components. You'll want to wait to plug them into the power supply until after you've done some cable management</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Starting with the 24-pin on the right of the motherboard, you'll want to brace the motherboard from behind as you push this cable in until you hear a click.</li>
                        <li>Next is the 8-pin EPS connector,labeled CPU, this will be split into 2 groups of 4 unlike the PCI express connector which is 6 and 2. This goes on the top left of the motherboard.</li>
                        <li>The PCI express cable is going to depend on your graphics card. You'll want to check the number of pins on the graphics card and match it up with a cable that works. We'll plug this into the power supply first and the graphics card later.</li>
                        <li>The harddrive cables come next, plug them into the drives and any RGB. Be delicate with plugging anything into the drives as they are delicate.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Time to do some cable management. Take your time routing the cables as you need to be able to close the side panels and it will help with airflow.</li>

                <li>Grab the graphics card and line it up to the slots on the case and the slot on the motherboard slot below the CPU, make sure the notch to the left of the slot is in the right spot on the GPU.</li>
